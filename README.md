# Infinite Precision Arithmetic

Overview
This Java project aims to address the limitation of the int data type by allowing arbitrary-precision arithmetic operations on positive integers. It uses a linked list representation to perform addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.

Key Features
Arbitrary Precision: Handle positive integers of any size using linked lists for efficient representation.
Basic Arithmetic: Implement addition and multiplication operations with proper handling of carry.
Exponentiation by Squaring: Perform fast exponentiation by squaring, significantly reducing computation time for large exponents.
